# SSRS-Inventory
Inventory-Reports for SQL Server Reporting Services 2008 R2 or later

Both reports look the same, only the RDL-Schema used in the Report-Definition and as namespace in the queries differ:

a) 2008R2 => RDL-Schema for SSRS 2008R2 - 2014
http://schemas.microsoft.com/sqlserver/reporting/2010/01/reportdefinition

b) 2016 => RDL-Schema for SSRS 2016 and 2017
http://schemas.microsoft.com/sqlserver/reporting/2016/01/reportdefinition
